# Explainable EWS FinRisk

This project is a research prototype that investigates how behavioural financial signals can be used to generate explainable Early Warning Signals (EWS) for post-disbursal risk monitoring.

The system focuses on:
- Behavioural risk feature engineering
- Explainable ML predictions (SHAP)
- Stability analysis of model explanations
- Interactive dashboard visualization

## Progress Log

### Phase 1
- Research experiments completed (Logistic + GBM + SHAP)
- Feature stability analysis across seeds
- Dashboard initialized using Vite + React + Tailwind
- Risk summary component created (static version)
